# Architecture Overview

Cargo workspace (Edition 2024, resolver 3) with 21 crates + binary root.

Requires Rust 1.94+. Native async traits are used throughout. `async-trait` is retained only in crates blocked by upstream dependencies (`zeph-core`, `zeph-mcp`, `zeph-acp` — blocked by `rmcp`).

## Dependency Graph

The layered architecture enforces a strict dependency direction: higher layers depend on lower layers, never the reverse. `zeph-core` (Layer 4) orchestrates all subsystems. Protocol crates (Layer 5) are feature-gated and wired by the binary. Sub-agent lifecycle state is defined in `zeph-subagent` (Layer 3) to keep `zeph-core` focused on the agent loop.

## Agent Loop

The agent loop processes user input in a continuous cycle:

1. Read initial user message via `channel.recv()`
2. Build context from skills, memory, and environment (summaries, cross-session recall, semantic recall, and code RAG are fetched concurrently via `try_join!`)
3. Stream LLM response token-by-token
4. Execute any tool calls in the response
5. Drain queued messages (if any) via `channel.try_recv()` and repeat from step 2

Queued messages are processed sequentially with full context rebuilding between each. Consecutive messages within 500ms are merged to reduce fragmentation. The queue holds a maximum of 10 messages; older messages are dropped when full.

## Key Design Decisions

- **Generic Agent:** `Agent<C: Channel>` — generic over channel only. The provider is resolved at construction time (`AnyProvider` enum dispatch). Tool execution uses `Box<dyn ErasedToolExecutor>` for object-safe dynamic dispatch, eliminating the former `T: ToolExecutor` generic parameter. Internal state is grouped into domain sub-structs: `MessageState` (message buffer, image staging), `MemoryState` (semantic memory, graph, summaries), `SkillState` (registry, matcher, prompt), `RuntimeConfig` (security, hooks, persona config), `McpState` (MCP tools, manager), `IndexState` (code retriever, indexer), `DebugState` (dumper, trace, anomaly detector), `SecurityState` (sanitizer, quarantine, exfiltration guard), and `ToolState` (schema filter, dependency graph, iteration bookkeeping). Logic is decomposed into `streaming.rs`, `persistence.rs`, and three dedicated subsystems: `ContextManager` (budget / compaction), `ToolOrchestrator` (doom-loop detection / iteration limit), and `LearningEngine` (self-learning reflection state). Concurrency uses `parking_lot` locks throughout (no poison handling)
- **TLS:** rustls everywhere (no openssl-sys)
- **Bootstrap:** `AppBuilder` in the binary's `bootstrap/` module (split into `mod.rs`, `config.rs`, `health.rs`, `mcp.rs`, `provider.rs`, `skills.rs`) handles config/vault resolution, provider creation, memory setup, skill matching, tool executor composition, and graceful shutdown wiring. `main.rs` (thin entry point) delegates to `runner.rs` for channel/mode dispatch
- **Binary structure:** `zeph` binary is decomposed into focused modules — `runner.rs` (dispatch), `agent_setup.rs` (tool executor + MCP + feature extensions), `tracing_init.rs`, `tui_bridge.rs`, `channel.rs`, `cli.rs` (clap args), `acp.rs`, `daemon.rs`, `scheduler.rs`, `commands/` (vault/skill/memory subcommands), `tests.rs`
- **Errors:** `thiserror` for all crates with typed error enums (`ChannelError`, `AgentError`, `LlmError`, etc.); `anyhow` only for top-level orchestration in `runner.rs`
- **Lints:** workspace-level `clippy::all` + `clippy::pedantic` + `clippy::nursery`; `unsafe_code = "deny"`
- **Dependencies:** versions only in root `[workspace.dependencies]`; crates inherit via `workspace = true`
- **Feature gates:** optional crates (`zeph-mcp`, `zeph-a2a`, `zeph-tui`) are feature-gated in the binary; `zeph-index` is always-on with all tree-sitter language grammars (Rust, Python, JS/TS, Go) compiled unconditionally
- **Context engineering:** proportional budget allocation, semantic recall injection, message trimming, runtime compaction, environment context injection, progressive skill loading, ZEPH.md project config discovery
- **Graceful shutdown:** Ctrl-C triggers ordered teardown — the agent loop exits cleanly, MCP server connections are closed, and pending async tasks are drained before process exit
- **LoopbackChannel:** headless `Channel` implementation using two linked tokio mpsc pairs (`input_tx`/`input_rx` for user messages, `output_tx`/`output_rx` for `LoopbackEvent` variants). Auto-approves confirmations. Used by daemon mode to bridge the A2A task processor with the agent loop
- **Streaming TaskProcessor:** `ProcessorEvent` enum (`StatusUpdate`, `ArtifactChunk`) replaces the former synchronous `ProcessResult`. The `TaskProcessor::process` method accepts an `mpsc::Sender<ProcessorEvent>` for per-token SSE streaming to connected A2A clients
