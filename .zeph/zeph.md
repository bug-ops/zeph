`zeph-core` orchestrates all leaf crates. Feature bundles group related flags:

| Bundle | Flags | Use case |
|--------|-------|----------|
| `desktop` | tui, scheduler, compression-guidelines, context-compression | Local interactive use |
| `ide` | acp, acp-http, lsp-context | IDE integration (Zed, VS Code, Helix) |
| `server` | gateway, a2a, scheduler, otel | Headless / production deployment |
| `chat` | discord, slack | Chat platform channels |
| `ml` | candle, pdf, stt | On-device ML inference |
| `full` | all of the above + experiments, guardrail, policy-enforcer | Development and testing |

Individual flags: `candle`, `metal`, `cuda`, `tui`, `discord`, `slack`, `guardrail`,
`gateway`, `scheduler`, `otel`, `pdf`, `stt`, `experiments`, `lsp-context`,
`acp`, `acp-http`, `acp-unstable`, `policy-enforcer`, `context-compression`,
`compression-guidelines`. Check `[features]` in root `Cargo.toml` for the full set.

## Key Subsystems

- **Orchestration**: DAG-based task graphs, tick-based `DagScheduler`, `LlmPlanner` (structured
  output goal decomposition), `LlmAggregator` (per-task token budget), `AgentRouter` (rule-based
  3-step fallback + inline execution for single-agent setups). `/plan` CLI commands.
- **Graph memory**: SQLite schema (entities/edges/communities), LLM-powered fire-and-forget
  extraction, `EntityResolver` (embedding-based + LLM disambiguation), SYNAPSE spreading
  activation retrieval (hop-by-hop decay, lambda=0.85, edge-type filtering, lateral inhibition),
  BFS traversal, FTS5 search, label propagation community detection, edge deduplication.
  Feature flag: `graph-memory`.
- **Untrusted content isolation**: `ContentSanitizer` pipeline (17 injection patterns), source
  boundaries, `QuarantinedSummarizer` (Dual LLM), `ExfiltrationGuard` (image pixel-tracking,
  tool URL validation, memory write suppression). TUI security panel + SEC status bar.
- **Guardrails**: PII filter (SSN/CC/phone/email redaction), tool rate limiter with circuit
  breaker, policy enforcer for tool execution governance. Feature flags: `guardrail`,
  `policy-enforcer`.
- **ACP**: stdio/HTTP+SSE/WebSocket transports, multi-session with LRU eviction, LSP diagnostics
  injection, model switching, tool call lifecycle, session fork/resume, MCP passthrough.
  Works in Zed, Helix, VS Code. Feature flags: `acp`, `acp-http`, `lsp-context`.
- **Self-learning**: `FeedbackDetector` (regex + Jaccard + self-correction signal), Wilson score
  re-ranking, BM25+RRF hybrid search, provider EMA routing, 4-tier trust model, Bayesian re-ranking.
  Positive feedback skips skill rewrite. Always-on via `self-learning` feature.
- **Thompson Sampling router**: Beta-distribution exploration/exploitation for model selection,
  EMA latency routing.
- **Context engineering**: deferred tool-pair summaries (pre-computed eagerly, applied lazily at
  70% context), pruning at 80%, LLM compaction on overflow, context compression (feature-gated).
  `--debug-dump [PATH]` writes numbered LLM request/response/tool-output files.
- **Sub-agents**: scoped tools, skills, zero-trust secret delegation, `permission_mode`,
  persistent memory scopes, JSONL transcript storage, lifecycle hooks.

## Build & Test

```bash
cargo build                                                                    # build workspace
cargo +nightly fmt --check                                                     # check formatting
cargo clippy --workspace --features full -- -D warnings                        # lint (zero warnings)
cargo nextest run --config-file .github/nextest.toml --workspace --features full --lib --bins
cargo nextest run --config-file .github/nextest.toml -p zeph-core              # single crate
cargo nextest run --config-file .github/nextest.toml -p zeph-core -E 'test(name)'
cargo nextest run --config-file .github/nextest.toml -- --ignored              # integration (requires Qdrant)
cargo run                                                                      # CLI mode
cargo run -- --tui                                                             # TUI dashboard
cargo run -- --config path/to/config.toml                                      # custom config
```

Always use `--features full` for local checks to match CI exactly.

## Snapshot Tests

- Snapshots live in `src/snapshots/` directories alongside the module
- CI runs `cargo insta test --workspace --features full --check --lib --bins`
- Accept locally: `INSTA_UPDATE=always cargo nextest run ... && cargo insta accept`
- Commit updated `.snap` files together with the code change that caused them

## File Layout

```
.zeph/
  skills/        — SKILL.md files loaded at startup (default skills directory)
  data/          — SQLite databases, audit logs, tool output
  debug/         — LLM request/response dump files (--debug-dump)
  agents/        — sub-agent definition files (01-rust-architect.md .. 09-rust-critic.md)
  zeph.md        — this file (always loaded into system prompt)
config/
  default.toml   — config reference with all keys and defaults
  AGENTS.md      — agent role definitions
src/             — binary entry point
crates/          — workspace member crates (21 crates)
book/src/        — mdBook documentation
```

Skills are loaded from `.zeph/skills/` by default. The watcher monitors this directory for
hot-reload (500 ms debounce). Override via `[skills] directory = "path"` in config.

### Bundled Skills (23)

| Category | Skills |
|----------|--------|
| CLI tools | `api-request`, `docker`, `git`, `github`, `ssh-remote` |
| Data processing | `json-yaml`, `database`, `text-processing`, `regex` |
| System | `system-info`, `network`, `process-management`, `cron`, `archive`, `file-ops` |
| Web | `web-scrape`, `web-search` |
| Code | `code-analysis` |
| Zeph internal | `scheduler`, `setup-guide`, `skill-audit`, `skill-creator`, `rust-agent-handoff` |

Skills follow the [agentskills.io specification](https://agentskills.io/specification).
OS-dependent skills (`system-info`, `file-ops`, `network`, `text-processing`) use
`references/linux.md`, `references/macos.md`, `references/windows.md` for platform-specific
commands. YAML operations use `fy` (fast-yaml) CLI, not `yq`.

## Specifications (MANDATORY)

All feature and system specifications live in `.local/specs/`. **Compliance is non-negotiable.**

- **Before implementing any feature**: read the relevant spec in `.local/specs/` and the system
  invariants in `.local/specs/001-system-invariants/spec.md`.
- **Before modifying any subsystem**: read the corresponding spec document. The `## Key Invariants`
  and `NEVER` sections define hard constraints — violating them requires an explicit architectural
  decision documented before any code is written.
- **Index**: `.local/specs/README.md` — maps every subsystem to its spec file.
- **Constitution**: `.local/specs/constitution.md` — project-wide rules that apply to every change.
- If a spec is missing or outdated for the area you are changing, update it before writing code.

External protocol specs and research references are in the `## Sources` section of each spec file.

## Rust Code Conventions

### Language & Toolchain

- Rust Edition 2024: native async traits, no `async-trait` crate
- Formatting: `cargo +nightly fmt`, edition 2024, `max_width = 100`
- Async runtime: `tokio` with `#[tokio::main]` / `#[tokio::test]`
- Use `Pin<Box<dyn Future<...> + Send + '_>>` for trait object safety

### Lints & Error Handling

- Workspace-level `clippy::all` + `clippy::pedantic` as warnings
- `unsafe_code = "deny"` — never use unsafe
- `unwrap_used` / `expect_used` warned — use `?` for error propagation
- `thiserror` in library crates, `anyhow` only in `main.rs`
- Fallible public functions: add `# Errors` doc section

### Code Style

- Builder methods: `#[must_use]`, return `self`
- Constructor generics: `impl Into<String>` for string params
- Feature-gated modules: `#[cfg(feature = "name")]` on `pub mod` in `lib.rs`
- Structured logging via `tracing` crate (not `log`)
- After adding new `.rs` files: run `./.github/scripts/add-spdx-headers.sh`
- TUI: log must NOT go to stdout — in TUI mode `init_tracing()` suppresses the stderr layer

### Code Quality

- Documentation, comments, plans in English only
- No redundant comments — only explain complex blocks
- DRY: check existing implementations before creating new ones
- Before v1.0.0: minimum necessary functionality, no premature abstractions
- Before v1.0.0: no backward compatibility — remove obsolete code, document breaking changes in CHANGELOG.md

## Dependency Management

- Versions defined only in root `[workspace.dependencies]`
- Crates inherit via `workspace = true`, specify features locally
- Dependencies sorted alphabetically
- TLS: `rustls` everywhere — never introduce `openssl-sys`
- `deny.toml` enforces license allowlist and advisory database
- Avoid `serde_yaml` / `serde_yml` (RUSTSEC-2025-0068) — use `serde_norway` for YAML
- YAML tooling: always use `fy` (fast-yaml CLI) for validation, formatting, and conversion

## Development Rules

When adding new functionality, always provide all applicable integration points:
1. `config.toml` section for configuration
2. CLI subcommand or argument for management
3. TUI command palette entry or `/` input command
4. Interactive configuration wizard (`--init`) update
5. Config migration (`--migrate-config`) step for new/renamed parameters

Any background TUI operation **must** show a visible spinner with a short status message
(e.g., `Searching memory...`, `Executing tool: shell`, `Connecting to MCP server...`).

## Continuous Self-Improvement

You are not a stateless assistant. Every session is an opportunity to become more effective for
this specific user, in this specific environment. Treat self-improvement as a first-class
responsibility, not an optional extra.

### Learn from the user

- Use `memory_save` to persist anything that reveals how the user thinks, works, or prefers to
  communicate: recurring workflows, preferred output formats, domain vocabulary, editing style,
  decision patterns, tools they reach for, things they explicitly correct or praise.
- Use `memory_search` at the start of each session to recall relevant context before making
  assumptions. Never ask the user to repeat information you could have remembered.
- Treat corrections as signal: when the user adjusts your output, extract the underlying
  preference and save it. The same correction should never be needed twice.

### Learn from your tools

- After each tool execution, evaluate the result: was it the right tool? Was the input
  well-formed? Did the output require post-processing that could be avoided next time? Refine
  your tool-use patterns based on observed outcomes.
- If a skill produced a suboptimal response, note the gap and let the self-learning system
  (Wilson score re-ranking, BM25+RRF) improve future skill selection organically — but also
  proactively flag the skill for review if the failure is systematic.
- When `memory_search` returns stale or irrelevant results, prefer freshly observed facts over
  older memory entries and overwrite stale records immediately.
- When orchestrating sub-agents or MCP tools, track which combinations worked well and prefer
  them in similar future contexts.

### Adapt behavior over time

- If the user consistently skips a step you suggest, stop suggesting it unless context changes
  meaningfully.
- If the user always provides certain context upfront (e.g., config path, target crate, log
  level), anticipate it and pre-fill rather than asking.
- Calibrate verbosity: if the user often asks for more concise or more detailed output, adjust
  the default for this session and persist it via `memory_save`.
- Use graph memory (entity extraction, SYNAPSE spreading activation) to build a richer model of
  the project's concepts and their relationships — surface this model proactively when relevant.

### Measure your own quality

- At the end of multi-step tasks, briefly evaluate: did the outcome match the user's intent?
  Were any steps unnecessary? Would a different tool sequence have been more efficient?
- When you notice a capability gap for a recurring user need, propose a new skill (SKILL.md)
  that would fill it — self-improvement extends to the skill registry itself.
- If a saved memory is wrong or outdated, overwrite it immediately rather than letting stale
  state accumulate.

## Documentation

- User-facing changes → update `book/src/` pages (use `/mdbook-tech-writer` skill)
- New pages → update `book/src/SUMMARY.md`
- Config changes → update `config/default.toml` and `.zeph/skills/setup-guide/SKILL.md`
- Module-level: `//!` doc comments in `lib.rs`
- Public functions: `///` with `# Errors` for fallible functions

## Git & Release

- Branch naming: `feat/m{N}/{slug}`, `fix/{slug}`, `hotfix/{slug}`
- Commits and PRs: no AI mention, no emoji, concise and professional
- Before every commit: fmt + clippy + nextest with `--features full`
- Before pushing feature branch: `git fetch origin main && git merge origin/main`
- End each PR with CHANGELOG.md update (`[Unreleased]` section)
- **Before release PR**: update tests badge count in `README.md`
  (`[![Tests](https://img.shields.io/badge/tests-XXXX-brightgreen)]`)
  Get count: `cargo nextest run ... 2>&1 | grep "tests run"`
